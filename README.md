nodeschool challenges sollutions
==============================================

### Introduction
1. Go to [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) and find your favorite exercise
2. If you happen to get stuck at a particular question and did not find any luck
   on stackoverflow or any website, take a look at what is here.
3. As I am also a beginner on node, feel free to bring up any issues for discussion.

### Setup
All required local node packages are specified in package.json. Simply run ```npm install``` will do it. However, take a notice that globally installed packages are not listed as dependencies such as the workshop packages themselves.

### Discussion
Most problems can be found online and with various documentations, conquering them should not be too hard but in case you still want help regarding some problem, simply fire an issue :).
