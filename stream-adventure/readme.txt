stream-adventure
==========================

As a beginner of node and unix pipe, I always find the concept of stream
not that comprehensive. If you are feeling the same way, that probably
means we should read more about basics of stream rather than just doing
exercises here.

Anyway, this is a pretty good workshop. So have fun!

For some of the solutions, I in fact referred to others' work and I am
commenting to solve some of the confusion.
